To implement S22 Encryption/Decryption simply place the S22Modules script in to your LUA project, preferably in a separate module file!

In your main script where you want to use S22: go to the very top and add this simple line of code: require "codelibrary.S22Module" --Codelibraryy is the name of my modules folder.

And now to using S22 it is really simple.
To Encrypt a message simply do:
local encMsg = S22Encrypt("Hello World!", 22) -- 22 is your bit key which you can change to be unique!
print(encMsg) -- Prints out the encrypted message

To Decrypt a message simply do:
local decMsg = S22Decrypt(encMsg, 22) -- I am using encMsg cause it is already a encrypted string variable. Also make sure that the bit key is the same for encryption and decryption!
